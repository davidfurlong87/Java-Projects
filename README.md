# Java Projects
A series of Java projects developed whilst with FDM. 


## Abstract Class Interfaces

A simple project built whilst studying abstract classes. 

## Annotations

This Java project showcases the use of Java annotations, including '@Retention' and '@Target', to develop a simple login application. The application demonstrates the power of annotations in simplifying and organizing code, as well as enabling automated data validation.

## Bank Design Project

This project implements a bank management system using interfaces and overrides. The system enables the creation of different types of bank accounts, including personal and business accounts, and offers functionality such as depositing and withdrawing funds, transferring money between accounts, and resetting account balances. The project demonstrates the use of OOP concepts, including polymorphism and inheritance.

## Collections

This Java collections project explores the different types of collections available in Java. The code demonstrates the flexibility and utility of different collection classes in Java and shows how they can be used to solve a variety of problems

## Constructors

This project is a Java Constructors project, showcasing the use of constructors in Java classes. The main application is represented by the "MainApp" class, which demonstrates the creation of User and Admin objects and their relationships.

## Exception Handling
In this project, the code creates different custom exceptions to handle different scenarios that may occur during the execution of the program.

## Generics
This allows users to create vehicles from different classes, and utilizes generics to create lists based on the abstract vehicle class that each vehicle class inherits from.

## IO Project
A simple project demonstrating basic IO operations, utilising Input Streams and File Readers.

## Java Algorithms
Some simple questions and answers relating to Java algorithms. 

## Java Persistence API Project
This project involves creating Data Access Objects (DAOs) and annotating data models to persist data in a SQL database.

#Logging
A basic example of logging in Java.
